# L‑Bracket Component (Autodesk Inventor Practice Project)

This repository contains a simple mechanical part modeled in **Autodesk Inventor** as part of a learning and practice exercise. The component is an **L‑shaped mounting bracket** featuring three holes for fastening. The model was created by following an online tutorial.

## 📘 Overview

The part is a small mechanical bracket typically used to join two surfaces at a 90° angle. It can be used in metal fabrication, woodworking, robotics frames, or general mounting setups.

**Key features include:**

* 90° L‑shaped profile
* Two side holes for bolts or screws
* One central hole on the base
* Chamfered/rounded outer edges
* Solid body modeled in Autodesk Inventor

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This model was created as part of my journey to learn Autodesk Inventor. The project helped me practice:

* Sketching and dimensioning
* Extruding and chamfering features
* Hole tool usage
* Fillets and edge cleanup
* Understanding part constraints and design workflow

## 📁 Files Included

* `L-Bracket.ipt` — Main Inventor part file
* `README.md` — This documentation
* `bracket.png` — Screenshot of the final part

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.ipt` file using Autodesk Inventor.
2. Inspect or modify the model.
3. Use features such as **Measure**, **Section View**, or **Edit Sketch** to explore the design.

## 📝 Notes

This model is not intended for real-world load-bearing use unless further engineering calculations are performed. It exists purely as a learning exercise.
